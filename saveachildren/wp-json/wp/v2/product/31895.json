To an English person, it will seem like simplified English, as a skeptical Cambridge friend of mine told me what Occidental is. The European languages are members of the same family. Their separate existence is a myth. For science, music, sport, etc. Europe uses the same vocabulary European languages are members of the same family.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The languages only differ in their grammar, their pronunciation and their most common words.
